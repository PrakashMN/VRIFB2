* HTML Introduction : HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It describes the structure of a webpage using elements,
and these elements tell the browser how to display content such as headings, paragraphs, and links.

* HTML Elements : An HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag, including the content in between, and it tells the browser how a specific part of the webpage should be displayed.

* Nested HTML Elements : Nested HTML elements means HTML elements can be placed inside other elements, and every HTML document is made of elements inside elements like <html>, <body>, <h1>, and <p>.

* HTML Attributes : HTML attributes give extra information about HTML elements and are written in the start tag as name="value". The href attribute defines a link address, while the src, width, height,
and alt attributes are used to display and describe images. Absolute URLs link to external files, and relative URLs link to files inside the project.

* HTML Headings : HTML headings are used to create titles and subtitles on a webpage, and they range from <h1> (largest) to <h6> (smallest) to organize content clearly.

* HTML Paragraphs  : HTML paragraphs are defined using the <p> tag and are used to display blocks of text. A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add space before and after it.

* HTML Styles  :  The HTML style attribute is used to add simple styles like color, font size, and background color directly to an element using the format style="property:value;".
It allows you to change how content looks, such as setting text color or the background color of an element.

* HTML Text Formatting : HTML text formatting is used to display text with special meaning like bold, italic, important, or highlighted. Tags such as <b>, <strong>, <i>, <em>, <sub>,
and <sup> help change the appearance and importance of text on a webpage.

* HTML Quotation : HTML quotation and citation elements are used to show quoted text or special references on a webpage. Tags like <blockquote> are used for long quotations, <q> for short quotes,
and elements such as <abbr>, <address>, <cite>, and <bdo> help display abbreviations, contact info, titles, and text direction.
* HTML Comments : HTML comments are used to write notes inside the code that are not shown in the browser. They help explain the code or temporarily hide content using the syntax <!-- comment -->.

* HTML Colors : HTML colors are used to change the appearance of text, backgrounds, and elements on a webpage. Colors can be written using color names, HEX codes, RGB, or HSL values, and they are usually applied using the style attribute.

* HTML Styles : CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and design web pages by controlling colors, fonts, sizes, spacing, and layout. It can be added in three ways: inline CSS using the style attribute,
internal CSS using a <style> tag inside <head>, and external CSS using a separate CSS file.

* HTML Links : HTML links (hyperlinks) are created using the <a> tag and allow users to move from one webpage to another. The href attribute defines the link destination, and the target attribute controls where the link opens,
such as _self (same tab) or _blank (new tab).

* HTML Images : HTML images are used to display pictures on a webpage and improve its design and appearance, and they are added using the <img> tag with attributes like src, alt, width, and height.

* HTML Favicon : A favicon is a small icon shown next to the page title in the browser tab. It is added using a <link> tag inside the <head> section, usually with a small image like favicon.ico.

* HTML Page Title : The HTML page title is defined using the <title> tag inside the <head> section, and it shows the name of the webpage in the browser tab.

* HTML Tables : HTML tables are used to organize and display data in rows and columns using tags like <table>, <tr>, <th>, and <td>.

* HTML Lists : HTML lists are used to group related items together and can be created as ordered lists `<ol>`, unordered lists `<ul>`, or description lists `<dl>`.

* HTML Block and Inline Elements : HTML elements are divided into block and inline types based on how they display on a webpage. Block elements like <p> and <div> start on a new line and take full width,
while inline elements like <span> stay in the same line and take only the space they need.

* HTML Div Element : The **`<div>` element** is a block-level container used to group and organize other HTML elements on a webpage. It takes full width by default and is commonly used with attributes like `class`, `id`, and `style`.

* HTML class : The **HTML `class` attribute** is used to give one or more elements the same class name so they can be styled or controlled together using CSS or JavaScript. Multiple elements can share the same class to apply the same design or behavior.

* HTML id Attribute : The **HTML `id` attribute** is used to give a **unique name** to an element, and no two elements can have the same id. It helps apply specific CSS styles or allows JavaScript to access and control that particular element.

* HTML Buttons : HTML buttons are created using the `<button>` tag and are used to let users interact with a webpage. A button becomes useful only when an action like form submission or JavaScript is added to it.

* HTML Iframes : An **HTML iframe** is used to embed or display another webpage inside the current webpage using the `<iframe>` tag.

* HTML JavaScript : HTML JavaScript is used to make web pages interactive and dynamic, allowing actions like responding to clicks, changing content, and controlling webpage behavior using the `<script>` tag.

* HTML File Paths : HTML file paths describe the location of files in a website’s folder structure and are used to link images, web pages, CSS, or JavaScript files. They can be relative paths (inside the project folders) or absolute paths (full website links).

* HTML - The Head Element : The HTML `<head>` element** contains metadata about the webpage, such as `<title>`, `<meta>`, `<style>`, `<link>`, and `<script>`,
and this information is not shown on the page. The `<title>` tag inside `<head>` defines the page title that appears in the browser tab and helps with SEO.

* HTML Layout : HTML layout elements are used to organize webpage content into structured sections or columns, similar to a magazine layout, using tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`.

* HTML Responsive : Responsive web design means creating web pages that automatically adjust their layout and content to look good on different devices and screen sizes, such as mobiles, tablets, and desktops.

* HTML Computer Code Elements : HTML computer code elements are used to display programming code or user input on a webpage, using tags like `<code>`, `<kbd>`, `<samp>`, `<pre>`, and `<var>`.

* HTML Semantic Elements : HTML semantic elements are tags that clearly describe the meaning and structure of webpage content, such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`.

* HTML Style Guide : The HTML style guide helps you write clean, consistent, and easy-to-read code by using proper indentation, lowercase tags, clear structure, and meaningful formatting so others can understand your HTML easily.

* HTML Entities : HTML entities are special codes used to display reserved characters or symbols in HTML, such as `&lt;` for `<`, `&gt;` for `>`, and `&nbsp;` for extra space.

* HTML Symbols : HTML symbols are special characters like ©, ®, €, and ✓ that can be displayed on a webpage using HTML entity codes such as `&copy;`, `&reg;`, or `&euro;`.

* HTML Forms : HTML forms are used to collect user input on a webpage using elements like `<form>` and `<input>`, and the entered data is usually sent to a server for processing.

* HTML Form Attributes : HTML form attributes provide extra information about how a form works. The **`action`** attribute specifies where the form data is sent when the user clicks the submit button, usually to a server file for processing.

* HTML Form Elements : HTML form elements are the tags used inside a form to collect user input, such as `<input>`, `<label>`, `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<option>`, and `<button>`.

* HTML Input Types : HTML input types define the kind of data a user can enter in a form, such as text, password, email, number, radio, checkbox, and submit, using different `type` values in the `<input>` tag.

* HTML Input Attributes : HTML input attributes give extra information about input fields, such as `placeholder`, `value`, `required`, `readonly`, and `maxlength`, which control how the input behaves and how users enter data.

* HTML Input form* Attributes : HTML input **form*** attributes are used to connect an `<input>` element to a specific form. The **`form`** attribute links the input to a `<form>` by matching the form’s `id`, even if the input is placed outside the form tag.

* HTML Canvas : HTML Canvas is used to draw graphics, shapes, images, and animations on a webpage using the `<canvas>` tag along with JavaScript.

* HTML SVG : HTML **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)** is used to create and display vector-based graphics like shapes, icons, and drawings directly inside a webpage using the `<svg>` tag.

* HTML Multimedia : HTML multimedia refers to adding audio, video, images, and animations to a webpage, allowing users to see and hear different types of media content directly in the browser.

* HTML Video : The HTML `<video>` element is used to display and play videos directly on a webpage with options like play, pause, and controls.

* HTML Audio : The HTML `<audio>` element is used to play sound or music files directly on a webpage, usually with controls like play, pause, and volume.

* HTML Plug-ins : HTML plug-ins are external programs that extend browser features to run special content like Flash movies, Java applets, or other multimedia, although modern websites now mostly use built-in HTML features instead of plug-ins.

* HTML YouTube Videos : HTML YouTube videos can be added easily by embedding a video using the `<iframe>` tag, where the `src` contains the YouTube video ID and the width and height control the player size.
